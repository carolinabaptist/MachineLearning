Learning: any process by which a system improves its performance from experience

Artificial Intelligence: Encompasses all techniques and technologies that allow machines 
to perform intelligent tasks. Includes: Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, 
Computer Vision, Robotics, Expert Systems, among others.

Machine Learning: field of study that focuses on developing algorithms and models that allow 
computers to learn from data and improve their performance on specific tasks with experience.

Data Science: Art of discovering implicit, previously unknown, and potentially useful 
knowledge from data. Machine Learning is a tool within data science. Combines statistics, 
data analysis, machine learning and other techniques to extract knowledge and insights from data.

Types of Machine Learning

Supervised Learning: The system learns from a training data set that includes the desired inputs 
and outputs (labels). The goal is to create a model that can predict the correct output for new 
inputs. Examples: Classifying emails as spam or non-spam, recognizing handwritten digits.

Unsupervised Learning: The system learns from input data without output labels. 
The goal is to find patterns or structure in the data. Examples: Grouping customers based on 
purchasing behavior, dimensionality reduction.

Reinforcement Learning:The system learns through interactions with an environment. You receive 
rewards or penalties based on the actions you take and adjust your behavior to maximize the total 
reward. Examples: Video games, robotics.

Traditional Programming: It involves writing programs explicitly to solve problems. Each step of 
the process is detailed by the programmer. Explicit instructions written by the programmer. 
Performance and accuracy depend on the quality of the instructions provided.

Classical AI: Based on heuristics and symbolic logic, where knowledge is encoded in explicit rules
and representations.

Machine Learning: Learning algorithms that find patterns in data and adjust models based on 
those patterns. The ouput is a learned model that can make predictions or decisions based on 
new data. Performance and accuracy depend on the quantity and quality of the data and the 
learning algorithm.

When to use ML:

1)In unknown or previously unexplored environments, such as the surface of Mars, there is no 
direct human expertise that can be applied. ML algorithms can be trained to identify patterns
and make data-driven decisions.

2)When Humans Can't Explain Their Expertise. Example: Recognizing speech patterns and human 
accents is something we do naturally, but it is difficult to explain all the details of how it
is done.

3)When Models Need to Be Customized. Example:ML can be used to create models that take into 
account patient-specific data (medical history, genomics, etc.) to recommend personalized 
treatments that maximize effectiveness and minimize side effects.
