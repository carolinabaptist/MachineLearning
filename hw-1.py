#Programming and critical analysis

#Considering the breast.w.arff dataset available

#Draw the class-conditional distributions per variable. Suggestion: use 3x3 plot grid.

#Using a 10-fold cross validation with seed=<group number>, assess the accuracy of 𝑘NN
under 𝑘 ∈ {3,5,7}, Euclidean distance and uniform weights to identify which 𝑘 is, empirically,
less susceptible to the overfitting risk.

#Fixing 𝑘 = 3, and assuming accuracy estimates are normally distributed, test the hypothesis
#“𝑘NN is statistically superior to Naïve Bayes (multinomial assumption)”.

#Given the empirical data collected along 5-7, enumerate two reasons that can underlie the
#differences in performance between 𝑘NN and Naïve Bayes.
